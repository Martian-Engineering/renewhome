## Overview

**Goal: establish a shared mental model**

* Leading models, personalities, use-cases
<!-- * Anatomy of a conversation
* Context management -->
* Vibe coding v. AI-assisted development

## Models: Personalities

## Models: Personalities

* **Gemini 2.5 Pro** – smart, TODO: Ted
* **o3** – slow, very smart, requires lots of context
* **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** – fast, excels at tool use, may rewrite React from scratch if you don't watch it closely

## Models: Use Cases

* **Gemini 2.5 Pro** - Day-to-day work with complex codebases
* **o3** - Solving tough problems given copious context
* **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** - Vibe coding, agentic workflows

## Vibe Coding v. AI-assisted Development

- What's the difference?
- If you're using AI, are you vibe coding?

## Vibe Coding
<!-- hide-title -->

> writing a sufficiently complex program requires not only the artifact of code (that is, the program source), but a *theory of the program*, in which an individual must fully understand the logical structure behind the code. Vibe coding; that is, writing programs almost exclusively by language-model generation; produces an artifact with no theory behind it.

## Vibe Coding 

* AI writes all the code
* Little to none is reviewed
* No understanding of the logical structure behind the code
* Good for:
  - Prototyping, experimentation
  - Throw-away scripts
  - Short-lived projects
* *This presentation was vibe coded*

## AI-assisted Development

* AI assists at various stages of development:
  - Understanding the codebase
  - Generating documentation
  - Designing an implementation plan
  - Writing code!
* The key difference from vibe coding:
* *You need to actually read the code and make the decisions!*
