## Live Demo

1. **Part 1**: Use VS Code's Agent mode
2. **Part 2**: Explore Sourcegraph

## Demo: Simple Feature
<!-- hide-title, lead -->

Let's add a feature: QR Code generation for current slide

<!-- 

0. Write document describing the feature I want.
1. Have a conversation with agent mode: 
  - What are the key files in this repository and what are their roles & resposibilities?
  - What part of the src is responsible for managing the overall "root" slide layout, rather than slide content?
  - What specific parts of code would be relevant for implementing the QR code feature in Step 0's document?
  - Update Step 0's document to provide an implementation plan.
  - Execute the implementation plan.
  - Note the git branch -- relate to system prompt
  - Review the implementation
2. This is overkill for a repo this small and a feature this simple

Sourcegraph Web UI

<!-- 

1. Add a repository: golang
  - Discuss open public repositories v. private/organizational
  - Discuss contexts
  - Search across many different repositories at once
2.. Universal code search
  - Search across repos by author:mrnugget type:{diff,commit}

Sourcegraph Cody

<!-- 

1. Added cody to sourcegraph, so we'll ask Cody about Cody
2. How does Cody's  "Document Code" feature work?
3. Where are golang's goroutines implemented?
  - How do they work at a high level?
4. What are some
