## Ideas

- Cody: 
  - Explain Cody feature: how does "Document Code" feature work?
  - How does Cody use tools?
- Universal Code Search:
  - repo:^github\.com/sourcegraph/cody$ author:mrnugget type:diff
  - repo:^github\.com/sourcegraph/cody$ author:mrnugget type:commit
- VSCode: Add a QR Code feature
  - Describe what we want in detail in a task document
  - Feed it as context
  - Watch it check out a new branch because system prompt
  - Generate commit message with Cody (segue to next section)
