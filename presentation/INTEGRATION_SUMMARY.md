# CloudWatch Integration Summary

The presentation is now fully integrated with AWS CloudWatch logging. This allows you to demo AI-assisted log analysis using the Log-Analyzer-with-MCP tool.

## Components Implemented

1. **AWS Infrastructure**:
   - Lambda function that logs events to CloudWatch
   - API Gateway endpoint to receive log events
   - CloudWatch Log Group for storing presentation events
   - IAM permissions and roles

2. **Next.js Integration**:
   - CloudWatch logging module (`cloudwatch-logger.js`)
   - Slide component integration with logging
   - Environment variables for configuration
   - Demo slide with interactive elements

3. **Documentation**:
   - Detailed runbook for CloudWatch operations
   - README updates with integration details
   - Test script for verifying connectivity

## Features Available

1. **Automatic Logging**:
   - Slide navigation events (when changing slides)
   - Content interaction events (when clicking on slide content)
   - Session tracking across the presentation

2. **Demo Capabilities**:
   - Custom event generation via demo button
   - Real-time logging to CloudWatch
   - Integration with Log-Analyzer-with-MCP

## Verification

All components have been tested and are functioning properly:

1. ✅ Direct API calls successfully log events
2. ✅ CloudWatch log group is receiving and storing events
3. ✅ Slides application is correctly wired to log events
4. ✅ Environment configuration is properly set up

## Next Steps for Presentation

1. Set up the [Log-Analyzer-with-MCP](https://github.com/awslabs/Log-Analyzer-with-MCP) on your demo machine
2. Practice querying the logs using natural language via Claude
3. Prepare a few example queries for the demo:
   - "Show me all navigation events in the last 10 minutes"
   - "Which slide received the most interaction?"
   - "How much time did users spend on each slide on average?"

## Remember

- The CloudWatch API endpoint is: `https://8yjaa747xl.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod`
- Use the `cloudwatch-logs-runbook.md` file for reference during the demo
- Logs are organized by date in the format: `slide-events-YYYY-MM-DD`
